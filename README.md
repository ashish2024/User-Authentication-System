# ABOUT THE PROJECT
The proposed system is a user authentication system in which will use Face authentication and QR code authorization for logging in. 
It will enhance the security of the system. The aim of this user authentication system is to verify the identity of users accessing an application or system, ensuring that only authorized users are granted access while preventing unauthorized access to sensitive data and resources.It is be robust, reliable, and easy to use to ensure the security and integrity of modern applications and systems.
This User authentication system can help prevent various types of attacks, such as
brute-force attacks, password guessing attacks, and credential-stuffing attacks. It
will ensure that only authorized users can access the data as face authentication is
used so no one else can access the data plus QR code authentication is also required
which is unique for each user and if any other QR code is used the user will not be
able to login. And if the face is not verified in some seconds it will throw time out
exception.


# QR-Face-Authentication-System

The **QR-Face-Authentication-System** is a versatile and secure authentication solution designed to enhance user verification processes across multiple domains, including mobile banking, e-commerce, college/student logins, and online payments. This system leverages both facial recognition and QR code scanning technologies to provide secure and efficient access control.

## Features

- **Facial Recognition:** Real-time facial detection and recognition using a webcam, ideal for secure login and attendance tracking.
- **QR Code Scanning:** Scan and validate QR codes for secure and quick access.
- **User Management:** Easily add new users and manage their profiles with facial data.
- **Attendance Tracking:** Automatically records attendance with real-time updates.
- **Real-Time Monitoring:** Immediate feedback on authentication status with visual indicators.
- **Secure Data Handling:** Safe storage and management of user data.
